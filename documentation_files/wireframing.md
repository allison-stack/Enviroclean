# Wireframing (interactivity included):

Log:
- As part of the project plan review I designed the main screen and different pages featuring different functionalities. 
  The design was basic to avoid bringing too much complexity to our frontend code.
- The design prototype can be accessed on Figma through this link: 
  https://www.figma.com/proto/z4MDkZKJkj6cKJdykeWkV6/Enviroclean?node-id=26%3A2&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A3
- Users can interact with the prototype by clicking certain areas.
  
Next steps:
