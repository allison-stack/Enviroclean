# Week of May 24, 2022:
- For this week, I am going back to continue working on the frontend of our project. I aim to make the buttons featured in the program work and create tabs for the 
  different functionalities of our app.
- Update: tabs were created, but the ui still needs work (tab still generates a blank screen)
- Next steps: I will work on making the ui work and gradually add in different tabs with different screens
