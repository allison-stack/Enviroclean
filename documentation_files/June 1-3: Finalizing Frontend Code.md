# June 1, and 2:
- These days were allocated to finish up the UI design for the app. Colors were added, and transitions were checked if they worked properly. The group met up
outside of school hours to discuss the next steps for the project on June 2nd. Some things we came up with include: merging the frontend code with the barcode scanner
code and integrating the machine learning model into the merged code. We plan to implement an API into the frontend if possible, but time will tell whether we will 
be able to get to that task. For now, we will focus on merging everyone's code together. APIs will come next.

# June 3:
- The barcode scanner was modified so that it returned an image of the product after scanning instead of a link to the image of the product being scanned. This will
be useful for the machine learning model. Also, the barcode scanner code was successfully merged with the front end code.
- Now all that is need to be done is implementing the machine learning model in the code somehow and start on the project help documentation.
