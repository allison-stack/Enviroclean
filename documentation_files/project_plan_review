Project Plan Review:

Log:
- As part of the project plan review I briefed over our Software Development Calendar 
  to make sure that all project tasks were present and that they all had reasonable deadlines.
- Some minor changes were made so that more project tasks co-incided with class work periods. 
  Other than that, the project planning looks good and should be feasible. This project is 
  aimed to be completed before June 6, 2022 (the last day allocated for this project) and 
  due dates for specific project tasks can be adjusted/moved around according to the situation.
  
Next steps:
- Move onto the creation of the closing plan of the project. This plan should give insight into
  what we aim to build and achieve from this project. This will help us keep the end in mind
  when working on this project in the future.
