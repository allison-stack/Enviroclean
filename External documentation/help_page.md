- Problem: ModuleNotFound error in terminal after attempting to run the program?
  - Solution: import the missing library by typing in 'pip install [module name]' in the PyCharm terminal

- Problem: How I you go back on the app? I misclicked a button.
  - Solution: Rerun the program. currently there is no back button present on the app, but it will be soon implemented in the near future! Keep a look out for it.

- Problem: Text in the background of certain buttons.
  - Solution: For now, it is supposed to be that way. In case if any of the image icons don't show up, the user can click the buttons according to the text written on  the button.

- Problem: How do I use this app?
  - Solution: Well, it's just a bunch of buttons... Click the buttons until you land on what you want. If you misclick, no worries just rerun the program again.
